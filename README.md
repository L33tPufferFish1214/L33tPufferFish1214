## 🔹 About Me

I’m currently studying Computer Science with a minor in Psychology and working toward a Human Factors certificate. I’m especially interested in how people interact with technology whether that’s through intelligent systems, machine learning, or user-focused design. My background helps me see and connect both the technical side and the human side of computing. I’m curious about how we can build systems that are not only smart, but also intuitive and ethical. Right now, I’m looking to gain more hands-on experience in areas like AI, ML, and information systems
