## ðŸ”¹ About Me

Iâ€™m currently studying Computer Science with a minor in Psychology and working toward a Human Factors certificate. Iâ€™m especially interested in how people interact with technology whether thatâ€™s through intelligent systems, machine learning, or user-focused design. My background helps me see and connect both the technical side and the human side of computing. Iâ€™m curious about how we can build systems that are not only smart, but also intuitive and ethical. Right now, Iâ€™m looking to gain more hands-on experience in areas like AI, ML, and information systems
